dptools readme file
-------------------

WHAT IT IS
----------

dptools is a collection of scripts I have made that I have found so useful
that I have decided to make them available to the public.

They run using BASH, PHP5 mostly.

FILES
-----
backup_databases - to backup databases and remove outdated backups
datekeeper - to keep modify dates on files, useful when tagging MP3:s in Winamp for example
dotshaper - simplified traffic shaping, based on wondershaper
dp_console_setup.sh - console formatter with a lot of aliases
dptools-update - to update the tools
dynamichost-updater - PHP-based DynDNS updating client
gettextrefresh - to update gettext PO files in multiple ways
grepa - simple yet very useful to recursively find files containing a text string
killr - kill -9 and killall in a combination, kills processes by keyword
